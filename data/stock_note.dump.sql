meloxicam. local anesthetics appear to lose efficacy when used in an acidic environment produced by inflammation whereas htx-011 addresses the issue by the use of an anti-inflammation agent. we see significant upside potential if htx-011 phase 3 readouts are positive. keypoints inflammation is an unmet issue in local anesthetics. local anesthetic failure has been observed when associated with inflammation. on page 2 and 3, we discuss two research publications to explain how inflammation can affect local anesthetics. two theories are summarized by the authors providing evidence of reduced efficacy in generic bupivacaine when used by itself. specifically, bupivacaine loses efficacy when used in an acidic environment produced by

27-28, then in late july really hit skids down till recently when it has now broken this long down trend but is in early stages of trying to turn up. . the 50 day ma is still way up at at 18.49 and top of boll band at 17.25, so if the other attributes as obv and rsi, macd [ which is starting to look decent ] can improve this looks a bottom in and it could be the start of some better prices. their antibiotic drug accepted by fda and pdufa is june 25. good analyst support and cash position better than many small bios. another tempting bios that bret likes, and sure seems to have some positives that could move price in coming days. this has been posted about a lot, but do feel stk is interesting at this price as risk/reward does look good. just needs some love like so many bios!!

one thing</p><p><br></p><p>cory renauer (novavax, inc.): influenza gets all the attention, but respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) sends more infants to american emergency rooms than any other virus. that\'s because an effective vaccine to prevent the disease from spreading remains elusive, despite 50 years of effort.</p><p><br></p><p>novavax, inc. is a small-cap biotech that was much larger a couple years ago, after its lead vaccine candidate became the first to show a statistically significant level of protection from rsv infection among older adults in a midstage clinical trial. the bottom fell out of the stock when the successful midstage results couldn\'t be repeated in a much larger vaccination study with older adults.</p><p><br></p><p>after its stock cratered, novavax rightfully noted that the failed study in older adults took place during one of the mildest rsv seasons on record. flu and rsv are entirely different viruses, but they tend to spread in tandem. if seasonality was the culprit, and this year\'s exceptionally rough flu season coincides with a higher rsv attack rate, novavax will probably announce success when it posts results from an ongoing maternal immunization study in a couple of years.</p><p><br></p><p>in a nutshell, investigators injected a bunch of expecting mothers with either a placebo or novavax\'s experimental rsv vaccine. a statistically significant decrease in rsv infections among newborns exposed to the vaccine in the womb would probably lead to an approval, and eventually more than $1 billion in rsv vaccine sales. biotech stocks generally trade at mid-single-digit multiples of their annual revenue, and at recent prices, novavax\'s entire market cap was just $604 million.</p><p><br></p><p>investors need to

greater in alpha fetoprotein (afp) concentration occurred in 3 of 8 (38%) evaluable patients. reduction in afp, a tumor marker expressed in patients with hcc, in early treatment may help identify a favorable response to treatment and was observed in both cases of partial response.hybrid dosing consisting of four weekly doses of trc105 at 10 mg/kg followed by every other week dosing at 15 mg/kg thereafter was tolerable when given with the standard nexavar dose of 400 mg twice daily.adverse events typical of each drug did not increase in frequency or severity when the drugs were administered

“importantly, the initial data from the current trial are consistent</p><p>with the 33% partial response rate by recist 1.1 reported in the completed phase</p><p>1/2 study published by the national
